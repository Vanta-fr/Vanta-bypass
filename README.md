# Vanta-bypass
Vanta Cleaner is a C++ tool developed by Wukey to forcefully delete files, bypassing protections like read-only attributes. It offers a color-coded console interface, providing feedback on success or failure. The program uses Windows API functions and wide-character strings for compatibility and robust error handling.
